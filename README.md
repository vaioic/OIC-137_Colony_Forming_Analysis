# OIC-137_Colony_Forming_Analysis

This repo is for the image analysis request to build a pipeline for counting cell colonies from brightfield images collected with a 10X air objective.

Files are multi-scene pyramidal czi. Because images were collected with brightfield and an air objective, there is significantly uneven illumination in each image, with the brightest signal in the middle and dimming out to the edge of the well.
